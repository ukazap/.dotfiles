this repo helps me set up a development environment quickly. some stuff may not be relevant for you, but they are for me, cheers.

to achieve portability across operating systems and linux distros, nix package manager is used.

there are two bootstrap scripts available:
  
  - `bootstrap.sh`: common stuff which is useful everywhere including cloud environments such as [gitpod.io](gitpod.io) or [codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces),
  - `bootstrap-desktop.sh`: linux desktop-specific stuff.

## installing

first, review the bootstrap script (common sense says you should not execute scripts you haven't read):

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/ukazap/.dotfiles/raw/main/bootstrap.sh | less
```

all good? then run it:

```shell
sh <(curl -L https://github.com/ukazap/.dotfiles/raw/main/bootstrap.sh)
```

## todo

* [x] use [antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/) to manage zsh plugins
* [ ] lock nixpkgs versions, use home.nix and home-manager
* [ ] restore secrets (e.g. gpg keys, ssh keys) from remote backups
* [ ] test on macos
* [ ] test on ubuntu
* [ ] add podman/docker in bootstrap.sh
